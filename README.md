A Flutter starter project that contains splash, sign in, sign up, password reset and email verification.
it uses Firebase for authentication and the BLoC pattern ([flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) library) for state management.

**Project was only tested on Android and the web.**

## Features

- Sign In (email + password or Google Sign-In).
- Sign Up.
- Password reset.
- Email verification.
- Firebase Analytics.
- Flutter web support.

## Setup

[`lib/src/configuration.dart`](./lib/src/configuration.dart) allows you to quickly enable/disable options. 

- `kUseGoogleASignIn`: [Google Sign-In](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in); not supported for Flutter web as of now.
- `kUseFirebaseAnalytics`: [Firebase Analytics](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_analytics); not supported for Flutter web as of now.
- `kUseFlutterBlocDelegate`: Flutter_bloc [delegates](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterfirebaselogintutorial?id=bloc-delegate).
- `kUseDevicePreview`: [Device Preview](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) package.

### Steps

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and add and Android app to the project. Please follow the installation instructions from the [Firebase Auth package](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth).
1. In the Firebase console, enable Email/Password authentication by doing: **Authentication > SIGN-IN METHOD > Email/Password > Enable > SAVE**
1. In the Firebase console, enable Google authentication by doing: **Authentication > SIGN-IN METHOD > Google > Enable > SAVE**
1. In the Firebase console, update the email address verification template by doing: **Authentication > TEMPLATES > Email address verification**
1. In the Firebase console, update the password reset template by doing: **Authentication > TEMPLATES > Password reset**

### Additional Steps for Flutter Web

**Important:**
You need the latest version of the Flutter SDK from the beta channel to compile this project. See
[Building a web application with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).

1. Add web support by running (restart your IDE aftert running the command):
```bash
flutter config --enable-web
```
2. Rename ```web/SAMPLE_firebase.js``` as ```web/firebase.js``` and update its content with the Firebase SDK snippet
from the Firebase Console (see [Resources](#Resources)).
1. Follow the instructions from [google_sign_in_web README](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in_web) and include your OAuth ID to ```web/index.html```, line 41.
1. Check this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59480956/browser-or-app-may-not-be-secure-try-using-a-different-browser-error-with-fl) if you encounter the “Browser or app may not be secure. Try using a different browser.” error with Google Sign-In.
